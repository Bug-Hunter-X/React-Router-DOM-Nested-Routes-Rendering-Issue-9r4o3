# React Router DOM Nested Routes Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in React Router DOM v6 concerning nested routes.  When navigating between a parent route and its child routes, the child routes may not render correctly or the parent route might not update as expected.  The issue seems to be related to how React handles component updates and the way React Router updates the DOM after navigation.

## To Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior when navigating between the Home and About pages.
